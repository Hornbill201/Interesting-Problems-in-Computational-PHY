# Interesting-Problems-in-Computational-PHY
Here are some interesting problems in Computational Physics. I did them in my undergraduate study in C language. They are homework problems of Prof. Zejun Ding's class. The reports are written in Chinese. If you are interested in some of the problems, please let me know. 
1. Random number generator using Schrage Method. Post-processing and statistical checks included.
2. Generate uniformly distributed dots on the sphere. 
3. Project the dots generated in Problem 2 to a 2-D plane. The distribution is included. The Marsaglia sampling method on a sphere is proved. 
4. Acceptance-rejection sampling method for Gaussian and Lorentz distributions. 
5. Comparison
