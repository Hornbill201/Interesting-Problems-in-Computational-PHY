# Interesting-Problems-in-Computational-PHY
Here are some interesting problems in Computational Physics. I did them in my undergraduate study in C language. They are homework problems of Prof. Zejun Ding's class. The reports are written in Chinese. If you are interested in some of the problems, please let me know. 

1. Random number generator using Schrage Method. Post-processing and statistical checks included.

2. Generate uniformly distributed dots on the sphere. 

3. Project the dots generated in Problem 2 to a 2-D plane. The distribution is included. The Marsaglia sampling method on a sphere is proved. 

4. Acceptance-rejection sampling method for Gaussian and Lorentz distributions. 

5. Comparison between the direct sampling method and the Acceptance-rejection sampling method.

6. Feigenbaum chaotic-dynamic systems.

7. 2D-DLA(Diffusion-limited aggregation) model simulation(Brownian motion). 2-D self avoiding walk model.

8. Generate fractal-tree using recursive method. 

9. Simulation of Ising model. (Q2 regulation)

10. Monte Carlo integration.

11. Prove the central limit theorem(CLT) using Monte Carlo method.
